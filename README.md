## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

<div style="text-align: justify"> The rapid expansion of mobile devices technology resulted in the increase of ownership and usage of mobile devices. One of the many industries greatly impacted by this movement are the news presses. Traditional news presses are compelled by readers to transform hard prints to digital prints. Entry barrier to the news press industry also became lower as the internet made it that much easier to communicate articles to the masses. Readers could now access alternative news sources from social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. <br><br> The web now contains an endless selection of articles, and a huge number of news providers. Readers are spoilt for choice, but this made selecting what one personally wants to read a daunting task. Major news presses need to cater to the general audience, hence could only categorize their headlines into the typical topics. From social media platforms, one was only limited to what were in their friend’s feeds, or tweets. <br><br> It struck our team that an app that could cater to the personal interest of a reader and automatically scoured the web for articles most suited to a reader’s personal interest would be of great utility. We wanted readers to focus on reading articles, rather than looking for the right article. <br><br> To achieve our objective, our team made use of web apis, which could at real-time, scour and build a database of news headlines. Then through interest levels solicited from the readers, we employed a rule-based engine to intelligently craft a list of articles personally suited to the reader. Apart from common topic labels (e.g. business, sports, science, etc) which articles already came in, we employed natural language processing techniques to label whether an article content was about local news, or whether it was about something trending on the net, all in the efforts to capture the user’s personal reading habits into our headline recommendations. <br><br> The rule-based engine was built with python and integrated to a web backend built using python-flask. The frontend was built using HTML/CSS/JS, and together with the web backend formed our News Curator app. </div>
